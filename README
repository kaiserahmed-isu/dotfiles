Nathan's dotfiles repository
============================

The idea is to put everything valuable in ~/dotfiles, but symlink them from ~/.
A helper script will take care of making the symlinks.

Subdirectories:

- bin: useful homemade helper scripts/programs 
- config: top level dotfiles linked into ~/
- perhost: files that are meant to be sourced on a per-host basis, named like `${HOSTNAME}.bashrc`


The script `setup_links` is meant to be run from within the root of the dotfiles repo.
Right now it links everything in `config/` to `~/`, and links everything in `bin/` into `~/bin/`.
It's designed not to screw with anything that already exists.
You can run it to fixup links after doing a pull, if something has changed.

I am considering not linking the bin/ files and just adding dotfiles/bin/ into my `$PATH`.
