This is Nathan's dotfiles repository.
The idea is to put everything valuable in ~/dotfiles, but symlink them from ~/.
A helper script will take care of making the symlinks.

Subdirectories:
    bin:
        useful homemade helper scripts/programs 
        do we symlink each entry here into ~/bin/
        or just add ~/dotfiles/bin/ to path?
        the latter seems a bit better
    config:
        (top level dotfiles)
        bashrc
        inputrc
        ackrc
        screenrc
        gitconfig
        gitignore   # default .gitignore file
        sshconfig   # .ssh/config  ?
        vim:
            the .vim directory
            note that vimrc lives HERE
    perhost:
        files that are meant to be sourced on a per-host basis
        ${HOSTNAME}.bashrc


There will also be a script to set up all these symlinks.
for each file to link:
    if destination exists:
        bitch
    else:
        ln -s $file $link
